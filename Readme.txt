All programs are Matlab based and needs to install Easyspin ( https://www.easyspin.org/) to execute.
"ESEEM_easyspin1e_1p.m" will generate ESEEM curves for spin system  one electron (S=1) and one proton, hyperfine coupled.
"ESEEM_easyspin1e_7p.m"  will generate the ESEEM curves for one electron + 7 proton and will also save the workspace in the end.
"streached_expo_FFT_plot.m" will perform exponential fitting to the ESEEM curves genarated from the 1e+7p program, then FFT and plots.
